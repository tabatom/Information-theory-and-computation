	For what concerns Ex2_a, after writing the first version of the program, the compiler
		can recognize that there is an "out of range" error and it does not compile.

	Newer versions suggest this:
	Error: Arithmetic overflow converting INTEGER(4) to INTEGER(2) at (1). This check can
		be disabled with the option ‘-fno-range-check’

	Using that flag the program runs but (obviously) gives the wrong result.

	Using INT*4 the compiler gives no errors.
