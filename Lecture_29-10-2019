	Doing things using Gnuplot
	
	Creating a document in which store numbers and to be loaded in gnuplot
	
	When loading a file, the standard options are to plot 2nd and 3rd columns
	To use others, use
		... using 1:3 with ...
	
	To get help, just type "help plot".
	
	Using command "set" we can change whatever set we want.
		set title "TITLE"
		set xlabel "time"
		set xrange [:10]
		replot
	
	To set output, use "set terminal"
		set terminal post color
		set terminal eps
					(nice format to quick add stuff to latex files)
	
	set output "test.ps"
	
	To save script:
		save "test.gnu"
	To load script:
		load "test.gnu"
	
	To plot more files at the same time:
		p "file1" w lp, "file2" u 1:3 w l
	
	splot "test.det" u 1:2:3
	
	To set a palette for colors:
		set pm3d
		replot
	
	To go back again to standard output (screen):
		set output
	
	To plot fancy stuff on columns of a file:
		plot "file.dat" u 1:($3-$2) w lp
	
	To plot from more files:
		p "<paste file1 file2" u 1:7
					(with paste comand we create a virtual file appending columns of file2 to those of file1)
	
		p "<sort file1 file2" u 1:3
	
	To do fits:
		# first define a function
		f(x) = a*x + b
		# fit
		fit [-10:10] f(x) "file" u 2:1 via a,b
						('via a,b' tells that those are the parameters to fit)
	
	To load more files we should combine gnuplot and bash commands:
		plot for [file in system("ls data*.dat")] file
